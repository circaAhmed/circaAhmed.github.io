<div class="entry-content"><p>Back in late 2012 and most of 2013 I was involved with <a href="http://www.jachicago.org/
" target="_blank">Junior Achievement of Chicago</a> while I was working as a systems integration Consultant for Accenture. I was part of a team that develop a new 7 week work readiness program for high school students in the 10th and 11th grades. I ran 2 of the first pilot programs at <a href="http://www.hubbardhighschool.org/" target="_blank">Hubbard High School.</a></p>

<p><strong>Lessons Learned</strong></p>

<p>Most of students that attended the work readiness program at Hubbard High School had a strong idea of what they want to be when they grow up. We had some aspiring nurses, teachers and police officers in the 11th grade class.</p>

<p>Outside of the work readiness program I spent some time conducting short 5 minute closing lightening talks for the students to cover areas I wish I knew when I was in high school.</p>

<p><strong>Most Overlooked Stats When Picking Your College</strong></p>

<p>One of the first lightening talks was about the most overlooked data when selecting a college or university.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>4-Year Graduation Rate</strong></li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/highest-grad-rate?src=stats">4-Year Graduation Rate</a> is usually a fantastic indicator for a well managed institution of higher learning that equip its students with the appropriate resources to graduate on time.</p>

<p>The undergraduate program I went to was at Florida international University, with a 4 year graduation rate of <a href="http://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/florida-international-university/academic-life/graduation-and-retention/#">18.9%</a>, I witnessed graduation delays of up to a year due to lack of class offerings required for graduation.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src = http://i.imgur.com/pD8MWvt.jpg width="450" height="450">
</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Average GPA</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>In a competitive job market with many fortune 500 companies with strict GPA cut-offs for would be applicants, knowing the average GPA of a college or university is critical.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src = http://imgur.com/eMON3rg width="450" height="450">
</p>


<p>I find <a href="http://www.gradeinflation.com/">Gradeinflation.com</a> to be a very good resource with average GPA data given to students attending universities across the U.S.</p>

<p>My advice would be if you are deciding between two programs and like them both equality, consider the average GPA for the school.</p>

<p>Professional schools such as in Law and Medicine and certain careers such as Accounting, Consulting and Investment Banking are quite GPA sensitive and if one is considering two programs that are on the same &ldquo;tier&rdquo; (perceived prestige), then attending a program that has a higher average GPA could help you in your first job search post graduation.</p>

<p>To plug in Florida International University once more, the average GPA given every semester is 2.74. Given the lack of recruiting power and perceived prestige, it would be hard to recommend when you have other similarly ranked schools in the region with close to 3.0 GPA averages and one of the more prestigious schools in the state, University of Florida, with a 3.3 GPA average.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Salary and Career Services</strong></li>
</ul>


<p>Studies released in the last few years have shown that up to a certain amount, <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2019628,00.html">money can buy happiness.</a> I wanted to make sure students understand that money should not be the end all be all in decision making but to consistently struggle with money can have a significant affect on well being and to make sure they are informed with the types of careers generally available to their areas of interest.</p>

<p>University career services is also a great place to look into when selecting a prospective university to apply to. I recommend prospective students email career services or look through their website to get a list of firms that hire from their university as well as what firms recruit on campus. A majority of my interviews were from University of Florida career week where a huge career fair is held bi-annually.</p>

<p><strong> Closing Thoughts </strong></p>

<p>My time working with Junior Achievement not only allowed me to become a mentor but also helped me reflect on what I wish I knew when I was in high school in the process of applying to universities. I look forward to continued mentorship opportunities in the near future.</p>
