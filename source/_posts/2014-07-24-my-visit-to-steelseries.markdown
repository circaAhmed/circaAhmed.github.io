I have been a big fan of <a href="http://steelseries.com/" target="_blank">Steelseries</a>, a gaming gear manufacturer, since I was in high school back in 2002/2003 with the heavy use of their hard plastic gaming mouse pads.

<a href="https://twitter.com/dastels" target="_blank">Dave Astels</a> was kind enough to give me a tour of the Steelseries location based in Chicago.

**How was the atmosphere?**

I found the atmosphere at Steelseries to be quite appropriate for a game peripheral design and manufacturing firm. Each Steelseries engineer had their own neat personal flare on their desks and the walls are adorned with some of our favorite gaming icons.

**How does Steelseries like to work?**

From what I gathered from my visit, it looks like the development team works on one project at a time with a kaban process management approach utilized. 

Some of the quicker projects such as re-branding a peripheral for a specific game or event can take 1 to 2 days while more complex projects coding projects can take as long as 3-4 months. 

**What tech does Steelseries currently work with?**

Steelseries recently rebuild the foundation of their codebase using <a href="http://golang.org/" target="_blank">Go</a> with the front user facing application build using javascript/css/html with some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Lisp</a> interaction to interface with the gaming hardware and sqlite database to store some peripheral specific data. Steelseries Lisp codebase is opensource for those of you interested! 

**Final thoughts**

With co-worker gaming nights on Fridays, gaming breaks in the office and an employee Donkey Kong high score list proudly noted in one of the team office rooms, Steelseries looks like a developer's gaming haven. 

PS. Big thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/dastels" target="_blank">Dave</a> for great parting <a href="http://steelseries.com/us/products/mice/steelseries-rival" target="_blank">gift</a>! Gaming mice have gotten so much better since my serious gaming days a decade ago.
