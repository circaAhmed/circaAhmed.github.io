Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/jmozen" target="_blank">Jen Mozen</a> and everyone at <a href="http://www.tablexi.com/" target="_blank">Table XI</a> for inviting me to their lunch talk series and for showing me around the work space!

Table XI is a development firm that works with startups and midstage companies to help them build products or to help serve as a defacto CTO for firms in need for tech expertise. 


**How was the atmosphere?**

I found the atmosphere at Table XI to be nice and open. I enjoyed the open space layout but I also felt employees were able to really get down and focus on their work at the same time with the help of headphones and the right tunes. 

**How does Table XI like to work?**

The Table XI team is comprised of over 30 employees and work in small teams of 4-5 co-currently on multiple projects at the same time. The small teams change up every 5-6 weeks.

Table XI has a full kitchen and offers employees free lunch daily. Lunch is very social at Table XI and I can tell from my visit that everyone has a lot of fun working with one another.

PS. The food was delicous!

**What tech does Table XI currently work with?**

I did not get much of a chance to discuss the tech that Table XI most commonly works with but I do know ruby and rails is a part of their tech arsenel. You can read more about tech challenges that Table XI face via their <a href="http://www.tablexi.com/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a>. 

**Final thoughts**

I found Table XI to be a very warm environment with a strong focus on a good work life balance. The leadership at Table XI are very approachable which was a nice experience.
