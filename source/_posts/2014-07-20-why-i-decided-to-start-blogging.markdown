After Graduating from <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> a couple of weeks ago, I find myself at loss for words and I feel this blog will not only serve as a vehicle for self reflection but also be a way for me to document my experiences working my way through the MIT Sloan MBA program for the next 2 years.

Some major themes I hope to cover include:
+ Career journey transitioning to the tech industry
+ Fumbling my way to coding fluency
+ Higher Education thoughts and experiences

I hope you enjoy!
